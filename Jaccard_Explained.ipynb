    "I was having doubts regarding the correctness of flattening an image after prediction and comparing with the flattened ground truth. So, I prepared this. The Jaccard seems to consider just the 1s (this is because by default in the jaccard function, the positive label is said to be 1) basically in the ground truth, there are three ones and 2 intersect. Therefore, intersection area or count is 2. In the predicted, there are 4 1s but there's a 0 in one place which should be 1. \n",
